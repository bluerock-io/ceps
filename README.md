This repository contains the RFCs (Requests for Comments) of the Rocq Prover
(formerly, CEPs, for Coq Enhancement Proposals).

To learn how RFCs work please read [RFC #0](https://github.com/coq/ceps/blob/master/text/000-coq-enhancement-proposal.md).
(Note that the text corresponds to the historical version when introducing CEPs,
and was not modified to account for the renaming of Coq to the Rocq Prover.
It may be subsumed by a new RFC process in the future.)
